# Python-Exploring-I-94-Traffic-Data

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to analyze westbound traffic on the I-94 Interestate Highway and determine influential factors on traffic patterns. Some of the following will be examined:

* Weather
* Time of year
* Month, Day, Hour

The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Usage

The dataset will be explored using Jupyter Notebook. To run the project you will want to install Jupyter Notebook. The easiest way to do this is by installing Anaconda Navigator. This [link](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) will direct you on how to install for your appropriate operating system: Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc. Once installed, you should have access to several applications, one of them being Jupyter Notebook.

`matplotlib` will be used throughout this notebook to display visualizations. It must be imported the following way in order for the visuals to display properly:

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`<br>
`%matplotlib inline`

## Brief Overview

Here are some important columns to note:

• `holiday`<br>
• `temp`<br>
• `weather_description`<br>
• `traffic_volume`<br>
